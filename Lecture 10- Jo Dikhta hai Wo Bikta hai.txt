			// Trending css Framework ---> Tailwind CSS
				
				css on the go (write in the same file)
				reusabillity
				Less bundle size as it is minimal css offer to us
				Flexible UI(customizable)  --> a lot of control over customization
				
				Always use npm package
				
				install tailwaind in our Project
				
				WHat is postcss ?  -> a tool for transforming css with javascript
				we need to tell our parcel project that we are tailwind in our project
				
				Does browser understand text-xl ,text-2xl?? NO 
				
			Question: What is postcssrc file ?
			--> it takes the configuration and tells our parcel that in our project there would be seen a lot of tailwaind classes 
				so we need to configure it that when we are bundling things up so compile tailwind css into Normal css
				
				===================================	01: 38:00=========================
				Tailwind configuration steps:
				
				1: install the tailwind and postcss
				2: tailwind init   -> create tailwaind config files
				3: tell config files what files do you want to scan
				
				now we have to configure our post css
				
				.postcssrc file
					{
						"plugins": {
							"tailwaindcss": {}
						}
					}
					
				index.css
					@tailwaind base;
					@tailwaind components;
					@tailwaind utilities;
				
				Done Tailwind configuration
				
				Tailwind Extension inside vscode: Tailwind css intelliSence
				
				if extension is not showing you suggestion --> ctrl + spacebar
				
				
				
				Question: what if I exactly have to give 200px ? 
						--> Square bracket notation --> you can give the dynamic valueto it.
				
				<div className="w-[200px]"  --> when you want to give width  exactly 200px 
				
				
				
			============================================2: 07=====================================
			
			A cool thing about tailwind css is let's go to sources and let's see our css file ... filter your css file 
			
			parcel is doing this stuff and parcel is taking the help of postcss and tailwaind library compile all those classes and
			ship into our project. 
			
			--> Tailwind css has 1000s of classes. So tailwaind css make sure you will only include the classes that 
				you have used in your project only those will be shipped to production. it makes the bundle size of css very small.
				Tailwind only include the file which we have used in. 
				
				
			NOTE: ADVICE
			
			--> whenever you are writing code right stick to the native tailwind classes. Don't write Dynamic classes why ??
		    --> first thing is tailwind understands it. tailwind won't create a new class for every dynamic class you write. 
			    So it will be having less code and it will maintian the consistency.

				 Suppose if  my website crosses the Thresold of width of small devices then make my header blue.
